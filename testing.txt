This unit test is going to test an application to book a dog walker 

no idea if this is what you mean but ......

If booking received for dog A
  check dogwalk list
  if dogwalk list contains 'A' 
      test passed
  otherwise
       test failed

  end if
end -if

For integration testing the different tests would be.....
 
1) the owner would book the dogwalk by adding their dog 'A' using service dogWalk.book() 
2) the service to read the dogwalk list database would be run dogWalkList.read() 
3) the dogwalker would check the dogWalk list to see what dogs were booked dogWalkList.output() 

Each of these would be tested as separate unit tests but would be integrated to check dogWalk.book() sent the details of dog 'A' to the dogWalkList database.  
Tests would be run to check the dogWalkList database includes dog 'A'

For System testing .... 

similar to the above I think but the system test to test the service to book a dog walk would be :

1) user to input dog 'A' to the dogWalk.book() service
2) the user would run the dogWalkList.output() service to write out which dogs are on the dog walk list
3) If the dog walk list contains dog 'A' then the system test has passed
