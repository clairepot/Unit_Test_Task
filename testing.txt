This unit test is going to test an application to book a dog walker 

no idea if this is what you mean but ......

If booking received for dog A
  check dogwalk list
  if dogwalk list contains 'A' 
      test passed
  otherwise
       test failed

  end if
end -if

For integration testing the different tests would be.....
 
1) the owner would book the dogwalk by adding their dog 'A' using service dogWalk.book() 
2) the service to read the dogwalk list database would be run dogWalkList.read() 
3) the dogwalker would check the dogWalk list to see what dogs were booked dogWalkList.output() 

Each of these would be tested as separate unit tests but would be integrated to check dogWalk.book() sent the details of dog 'A' to the dogWalkList database.  
Tests would be run to check the dogWalkList database includes dog 'A'

For System testing .... 

similar to the above I think but the system test to test the service to book a dog walk would be :

1) user to input dog 'A' to the dogWalk.book() service
2) the user would run the dogWalkList.output() service to write out which dogs are on the dog walk list
3) If the dog walk list contains dog 'A' then the system test has passed

For Acceptance Testing....

The test scenario would be: 
As a client I want to use the Dog Walk booking service so that I can book a walk for my dog on a certain date

Given - The client is on the booking page
When - the client selects a date/time slot that has an empty space
Then - the client should be taken to a booking confirmation page which displays a message confirming their dog walk is booked

Given - The client is on the booking page
When - the client selects a date/time slot that is already full
Then - A message should appear to say that there is no space in that slot and prompt the client to choose an alternative slot
